The project "Commemorating their memory" was established following the desire to get to know our heroes up close
To leave pieces of information and the possibility for friends and relatives to leave a piece of memory that will be open and accessible to anyone who wants to remember, recall and be inspired by the saints who were killed on Kiddush D, just by virtue of being Jews
We would be happy if you could add information about a space you knew, a recipe he liked, a picture of you together, a sweet memory you have and want to share from him and to all those who don't know
There is an option to volunteer and read chapters of the Psalms for the uplifting of the souls of the dead
